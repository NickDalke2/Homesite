 		<p> Giftdr is a birthday reminder app that uses the user's input about their friends to suggest gifts for them around birthdays and other holidays. It connects to the Amazon API to make their shopping easier and alerts them at two, and then again one, week(s) out from the special day

 		<h2> Languages: CSS, HTML, JQuery </h2>
 		<p> This is my homepage, designed to be a portfolio and a portfolio piece. I can simply add a new planet every time I complete a new project. Made in HTML and relying heavily on CSS and JQuery visitors can mouse over each orbiting planet to learn more about a project.

 		<h1> Tetris </h1>
 		<h2> Languages: Swift </h2>
 		<p> The time-honored classic, I built my own clone of it as practice with the Swift game layer, user the column/row grid layout and swipe events to control the orientation of the blocks.

	<div id="project_form_Rosie">
 		<h1> Rosie </h1>
 		<h2> Languages: Swift </h2>
 		<p>Rosie is a native Swift based iPhone app and soon to be the world's most advanced baby monitor. I designed it to reduce the incidence of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome), a condition where babies stop breathing in their sleep. Having only had a week to learn Swift, I built Rosie to utilize a pre-fabricated motion processing system. The next version will utilize a sophisticated Eulerian based image processing algorithm to detect changes in motion invisible to the human eye, then trigger an alarm when motions associated with breathing cease. The goal being to wake the baby up and have them resume breathing on their own. My main obstacles to completing Rosie were two-fold. First there was the fact that literally no one else at GA (instructors included) knows Swift. I was completely and utterly on my own. I did find out that there's a mobile class that comes in at night so I was able to ask one question of that instructor, but other than that I used online resources all the way. Second, Swift is so ridiculously new that there is only a single motion detection API that I could find to incorporate into Rosie, and it's not sensitive enough to do what I need. I have found something that is, but I need to learn MatLab so I can translate it from MatLab to Swift. Challenge accepted!
